A ksh function which prints files with
cat or less depending on the number of lines.
Default: use cat if #lines <= 3/4 * $LINES

Several files can be given as the last
commandline arguments or one file can be
specified in the variable s.
Only one of both variants is used.
Commandline arguments take precedence over $s.
For example, both commands print the same file:
  $ v ~/notes/openbsd
  $ s=~/notes/openbsd v

usage: s=file v [-dhnV] [-l lines]
              v [-dhnV] [-l lines] file ...

options:
      -h          print this help
      -d          decode quoted-printables
      -l #lines   number of lines when to use less
      -n          print line numbers
      -V          prints version and exits


Note:
- For the -d option to work you also need the qpc [0] script or any other
  tool which can decode Quoted-printables.
- To use ksh functions the FPATH environment variable must be set to the
  path the function resides in. The same path must als be set in the
  PATH environment variable.
  E.g.:
  $ export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin/funcs
  $ export FPATH=$FPATH:$HOME/bin/funcs
